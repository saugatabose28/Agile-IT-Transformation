    -> mvn clean
    -> mvn install
    -> cd target
    -> java -jar MercuryCyclists-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Note: BI Service Test Data
Currently the BI service has been set up with a command line runner that is launched when
the application has been run. This will first send a request to the inventory service to create
three products. Then it will continue to request the sales service to create a sale every two
seconds.
To ensure the application launches with test data, we must first ensure that Kafka is running,
as well as the inventory and Sales services.
If you would not like to create test data, comment out the command line runner functionality
when launching the BI service.
